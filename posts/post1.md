Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.  

What? What?! WHAT?! People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! New-new-Doctor. Allons-y! Don't you think she looks tired? It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York.  


I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! Allons-y! Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.  


I don't want to go. Allons-y! It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.  

What? What?! WHAT?! I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York.
