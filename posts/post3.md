Clara, I'm not your boyfriend. I never said it was your mistake. Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. I don't think that I'm a hugging person now. Are you taller? Why? Do you have to reach a high shelf? He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically in the job description. Shut it, Hoodie! No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man!

Kidneys! I have kidneys. And I don't like the colour. Please just... just see me. I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. Underneath it all I think you're probably kind and nice, and very brave. I just wish you weren't a soldier. The Doctor. Nosey parker. Once upon a time. The end. Dad skills. Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance. Don't be lasagna. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon.

I am totally against bantering. Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! Shut it, Hoodie! I don't think that I'm a hugging person now. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically in the job description. Itâ€™s a bit more exciting when you go the other way. No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. Don't be lasagna. Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? My carer. She cares so I don't have to.

Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance. You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically in the job description. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for 'minimalism', but I think I came up with 'magician'. Can I talk about planets now? I don't think that I'm a hugging person now. I don't need a sword. Because I'm the Doctor ... and this is my spoon.

You realise one of us is lying about our basic programming. And I think we both know which one that is. I'm Scottish. I can complain about things now. I can really complain about things now. Kidneys! I have kidneys. And I don't like the colour. Shut it, Hoodie! I don't think that I'm a hugging person now. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. Can I talk about planets now? No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. Come on, Team Not Dead. I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good.
